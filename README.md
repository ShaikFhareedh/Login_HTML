# Login_HTML
This code will create a simple login page with two input fields, one for the username and one for the password. The submit button will submit the form data to the server.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

The <fieldset> element is used to create a fieldset, which is a container for other elements.
The <h1> element is used to create a heading.
The <input> element is used to create an input field. The type="text" attribute specifies that the input field is a text field. The placeholder="Username" attribute specifies that the placeholder text for the input field is "Username".
The <br> element is used to insert a line break.
The <button> element is used to create a button. The type="submit" attribute specifies that the button is a submit button.
You can customize the look and feel of the login page by adding CSS. For example, you can change the font, color, and size of the text, and you can change the background color of the page.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
